## Project Overview  
This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis between two types of grippers used in robotic manipulation: a 3-finger parallel gripper and a 3-finger adaptive gripper. The research will begin with a description of the development of the parallel gripper and will continue with the design of an adaptive phalanx that will convert the developed parallel gripper into an adaptive gripper. Additionally, the analysis will include a thorough evaluation of the performance of both devices, with particular emphasis on their manipulation capabilities.
The 3D modeling will be carried out using SolidWorks software.

Open-source comparison of two robotic gripper designs:  
- 3-Finger Parallel Gripper  
- 3-Finger Adaptive Gripper (convertible from parallel version)  

Designed for academic research and DIY robotics enthusiasts.
